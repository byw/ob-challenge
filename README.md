# Coding Challenge

## Instructions

* Run `bundle` to install gems.
* Run `rspec` to run tests.
* Run `./run_challenge 1 sample_input.csv` to run challenge 1.
* Run `./run_challenge 2 sample_input.csv` to run challenge 2.

## Source files
* Main code under `/lib`
* Tests in `/spec`

## Some technical choices
* Using BigDecimal for numbers, to preserve accuracy in arithmetic.
* If I had more time, I'd add more handling of edge cases. (eg. proper CSV but wrong columns)
